# Graph Visualizing Desktop Tool

## 🧭 Overview
A powerful and intuitive desktop application for creating and visualizing directed graphs. Built with JavaFX and Kotlin, this tool enables users to interactively build graphs, visualize them in real-time, and export to Mermaid flowchart syntax for easy sharing and documentation.

## ✨ Features
- Interactive creation and manipulation of directed graphs
- Real-time visualization using JavaFX
- Automatic generation of Mermaid flowchart syntax
- Smooth, non-blocking UI for a responsive experience
- Robust exception handling with fallback mechanisms
- Unit tests implemented for core components: `Graph` and `MermaidRenderer`

## 🔧 Technologies Used
